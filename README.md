# Welcome to the RELLCC Transformation Ecosystem

## Dedicated to the Legacy of Hattie M. Waters (1947–1965)

This organization serves as the digital foundation for **Restore Executive Life and Leadership Coaching and Consulting, LLC**. Our mission is to facilitate "Restoration" through the proprietary **8 A’s of Transformation** framework.

### 🏛️ The Three Pillars of Our Ecosystem

Our work is built upon three interconnected repositories that inform our AI-powered coaching tools and the "Digital Fountain" platform:

1. **[The Core Narrative](https://github.com/DT-BDLM/Hattie-M-Waters-Core-Narrative)** *The Alpha: The 1958 Tunnel Experience and the heart of our mission.*

2. **[The 8 A’s Framework](https://github.com/DT-BDLM/Hattie-M-Waters-8As-Framework)** *The Logic: The technical architecture and meditative path of ascension.*

3. **[Lessons from the Tunnel](https://github.com/DT-BDLM/Lessons-From-Hatties-Tunnel)** *The Omega: Actionable coaching principles and technical application layer.*

### 🚀 Vision for Developers
We are building a "Digital Fountain" of intentional evolution. Developers (Leon and Michael) are encouraged to use these repositories as the primary context for AI grounding, UI/UX theme consistency (The 8 Colors), and narrative integrity.
